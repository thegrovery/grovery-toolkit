**Server-side Rendering**, aka SSR, can be enabled in Astro. When you enable SSR you can:

- Implement sessions for login state in your app.
- Render data from an API called dynamically with `fetch`.
- Deploy your site to a host using an *adapter*.

## Enabling SSR in Your Project

To get started, enable SSR features in development mode with the `output: server` configuration option:

```js ins={5}
// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'server'
});
```

### Adding an Adapter

When it's time to deploy an SSR project, you also need to add an adapter. This is because SSR requires a server _runtime_: the environment that runs your server-side code. Each adapter allows Astro to output a script that runs your project on a specific runtime.

The following adapters are available today with more to come in the future:

- [Cloudflare](/en/guides/integrations-guide/cloudflare/)
- [Deno](/en/guides/integrations-guide/deno/)
- [Netlify](/en/guides/integrations-guide/netlify/)
- [Node.js](/en/guides/integrations-guide/node/)
- [Vercel](/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/)

#### `astro add` Install

You can add any of the official adapters with the following `astro add` command. This will install the adapter and make the appropriate changes to your `astro.config.mjs` file in one step. For example, to install the Netlify adapter, run:

<PackageManagerTabs>
  <Fragment slot="npm">
  ```shell
  npx astro add netlify
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="pnpm">
  ```shell
  pnpm astro add netlify
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="yarn">
  ```shell
  yarn astro add netlify
  ```
  </Fragment>
</PackageManagerTabs>

#### Manual Install

You can also add an adapter manually by installing the package and updating `astro.config.mjs` yourself. (See the links above for adapter-specific instructions to complete the following two steps to enable SSR.) Using `my-adapter` as an example placeholder, the instructions will look something like:

1. Install the adapter to your project dependencies using your preferred package manager:

   <PackageManagerTabs>
     <Fragment slot="npm">
     ```shell
     npm install @astrojs/my-adapter
     ```
     </Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="pnpm">
     ```shell
     pnpm install @astrojs/my-adapter
     ```
     </Fragment>
     <Fragment slot="yarn">
     ```shell
     yarn add @astrojs/my-adapter
     ```
     </Fragment>
   </PackageManagerTabs>

2. [Add the adapter](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#adapter) to your `astro.config.mjs` file's import and default export:

    ```js ins={3,6-7}
    // astro.config.mjs
    import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
    import myAdapter from '@astrojs/my-adapter';

    export default defineConfig({
      output: 'server',
      adapter: myAdapter(),
    });
    ```

## Features

Astro will remain a static-site generator by default. But once you enable a server-side rendering adapter, **every route in your pages directory defaults to a server-rendered route** and a few new features become available to you.

### Hybrid Rendering

<Since v="2.0.0" />

To enable **hybrid rendering**, any [page](/en/core-concepts/astro-pages/) or [server endpoint](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes) that supports exporting variables (`.astro`, `.mdx`, `.ts`, or `.js`) can opt-in to prerendering. These files will be statically rendered at build-time, similar to the default static [`output`](/en/reference/configuration-reference/#output) mode.

Simply add `export const prerender = true`:

```astro title="src/pages/mypage.astro" {2}
---
export const prerender = true;
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

```mdx title="src/pages/mypage.mdx" {5}
---
layout: '../layouts/markdown.astro'
title: 'My page'
---
export const prerender = true;

# This is my page
```


```js title="src/pages/myendpoint.js" {1}
export const prerender = true;

export async function get() {
  return {
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: `This is my endpoint` }),
  };
}
```

### `Astro.request.headers`

The headers for the request are available on `Astro.request.headers`. It is a [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Headers) object, a Map-like object where you can retrieve headers such as the cookie.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {2}
---
const cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie');
// ...
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

:::caution
The features below are only available at the page level. (You can't use them inside of components, including layout components.)

This is because these features modify the [Response headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Response_header), which can't be modified after they're sent to the browser. In SSR mode, Astro uses HTML streaming to send each component to the browser as it renders them. This makes sure the user sees your HTML as fast as possible, but it also means that by the time Astro runs your component code, it has already sent the Response headers.

### `Astro.cookies`

This is a utility to read and modify a single cookie. It allows you to check, set, get and delete a cookie.

See more details about [`Astro.cookies` and the `AstroCookie` type](/en/reference/api-reference/#astrocookies) in the API reference.

The example below updates the value of a cookie for a page view counter.

```astro title="src/pages/index.astro" {4,5,9}
---
let counter = 0

if(Astro.cookies.has("counter")){
  const cookie = Astro.cookies.get("counter")
	counter = cookie.number() + 1
}

Astro.cookies.set("counter",counter)

---
<html>
  <h1>Counter = {counter}</h1>
</html>
```

### `Astro.redirect`

On the `Astro` global, this method allows you to redirect to another page. You might do this after checking if the user is logged in by getting their session from a cookie.

```astro title="src/pages/account.astro" {8}
---
import { isLoggedIn } from '../utils';

const cookie = Astro.request.headers.get('cookie');

// If the user is not logged in, redirect them to the login page
if (!isLoggedIn(cookie)) {
  return Astro.redirect('/login');
}
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

### `Response`

You can also return a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) from any page. You might do this to return a 404 on a dynamic page after looking up an id in the database.

```astro title="src/pages/[id].astro" {8-11}
---
import { getProduct } from '../api';

const product = await getProduct(Astro.params.id);

// No product found
if (!product) {
  return new Response(null, {
    status: 404,
    statusText: 'Not found'
  });
}
---
<html>
  <!-- Page here... -->
</html>
```

### Server Endpoints

A server endpoint, also known as an **API route**, is a special function exported from a `.js` or `.ts` file within the `src/pages/` folder. 
The function takes an [endpoint context](/en/reference/api-reference/#endpoint-context) and returns a [Response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response). A powerful feature of SSR, API routes are able to securely execute code on the server. To learn more, see our [Endpoints Guide](/en/core-concepts/endpoints/#server-endpoints-api-routes).
