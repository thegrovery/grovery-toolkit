Now that you have some blog posts, let's use Astro's API to work with your files!

## Where are we now?

You can find the code at this point in the tutorial on [GitHub](https://github.com/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-5/start) or
[StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/unit-5/start?file=src/pages/index.astro).

Check your code against this example, or if you've just joined us, fork on StackBlitz to start coding along in your browser from here.

## Where are we going?

In this unit, you'll supercharge your blog with an index page, tag pages, and an RSS feed. 

Along the way, you'll learn how to use:
- `Astro.glob()` to access data from files in your project
- `getStaticPaths()` to create multiple pages (routes) at once
- The Astro RSS package to create an RSS feed
