<summary>Unit 1 is things I already know how to do. Can I skip it?</summary>

You can use the lessons inside [Unit 1](/en/tutorial/1-setup/) to make sure you have the development tools and online accounts you'll need to complete the tutorial. It will walk you through creating a new Astro project, storing it on GitHub, and deploying it to Netlify.

If you [create a new, empty Astro project](/en/install/auto/) and are comfortable with your setup, you can safely skip ahead to [Unit 2](/en/tutorial/2-pages/) where you will start making new pages in your project.
